#Voltaire Publication data from the BnF catalog

These files contain data about the editions of Voltaire's works until 1800. The data have been retrieved during the second half of 2012 from the Linked Data portal of the BnF (data.bnf.fr) and the library's online catalog (www.bnf.fr).

We focused our attention on the editions cataloged as "Texte imprimé, monographie". Where a date was not available for an edition, we determined its chronological attribution based on the bibliographic notes written by the catalogers.

Since our aim was to determine Voltaire's geography of publication, we divided the retrieved records in three groups:

- Editions with a single place of publication (e.g. "Genève : Cramer, 1762")
- Editions with two places of publication (e.g. "La Haye; Berlin : J. Neaulme, 1736")
- Editions with a place of publication and a place of distribution (e.g. "Imprimée à Rouën : chez Jore ; et se vend à Paris : Chez J.-B. Bauche, 1736")

The files in these folder reflect this categorization. A link to the original record in the BnF catalog is provided as well for every record. Where Voltaire was not the only author, we also recorded the co-authors.

Concerning the places of publication, we analyzed the data in order to distinguish between a stated place and a possible known place that may differ from the stated one. For instance, in "Paris [i. e. Lausanne] : [J.-P. Heubach], 1779", the stated place is "Paris", the real (known) place is "Lausanne". The same approach has been used for the year of publication and for the names of the publishers.

The criteria adopted for this analysis have been identified by Prof. Dan Edelstein.
