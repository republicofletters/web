<p><strong>Networks: Ecological, Revolutionary, Digital</strong> <br />Dan Edelstein (French and Italian) and Deborah Gordon (Biology)<br />Teaching fellows: Melanie Conroy, Elizabeth Coggeshall and Nicole Martinez-Martin</p>

<p>Why is the word network used to describe the behavior of computers, ants, and people? Do all these networks share certain properties, and what might we learn by comparing them? We like to think of social networks as a contemporary phenomenon. But before Facebook, individuals organized themselves in social networks; before Twitter, revolutionaries used media to communicate and coordinate their messages. In fact, even animal societies are networked. Through project-based exercises, you will learn to study, analyze, and write about networks from the perspectives of a biologist, a computer scientist, and a historian. We will retrace social networks in the 18th and 21st centuries, observe the organization of animal networks, and investigate the structure of online networks. Our goal is to use the concept of the network to deepen our understanding of the natural world, historical change, and our own social lives.</p>
<p>This Enlightenment project asks students to use the concepts of network theory to analyze key individuals and key moments in intellectual history. After choosing a major intellectual figure of the Scientific Revolution or Enlightenment (17th or 18th centuries), students determine the different networks in which that intellectual took part. In this way, we seek to understand which networks were important to making certain individuals – but also certain intellectual movements – successful, as well as to understand how these different movements depended on different networks.</p>

<p>List of the intellectual figures whose networks the students are mapping:<br />John Adams, Robert Boyle, Nicolaus Copernicus, René Descartes, Denis Diderot, Benjamin Franklin, Galileo Galilei, Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Jefferson, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, James Madison, Montesquieu, Isaac Newton, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Voltaire, George Washington</p>

<p><strong>Republic Of Letters: Knowledge And Community, 1300-1800</strong> Paula Findlen And Robert Fredona</p>

<p>How did a &#8220;republic of letters&#8221; emerge in the Renaissance and undergo multiple transformations during the Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Enlightenment? How did knowledge, communication, and community change between the age of Renaissance humanists such as Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Erasmus, the invention of printing, the political, religious and intellectual upheavals of the seventeenth century, and the trans-Atlantic, cosmopolitan world of salons, libraries, and enlightened philosophers such as Voltaire, Gibbon, and Franklin?</p>
