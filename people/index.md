####Dan Edelstein 
Associate Professor of French and, by courtesy, of History; Director of Undergraduate Studies, DLCL; Chair of Undergraduate Studies, French; Primary Investigator, Mapping the Republic of Letters.
<span id="edelstein"></span>


Dan Edelstein works primarily on eighteenth-century France, which also serves as a convenient launching pad for raids into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as the early modern period. His first book, [*The Terror of Natural Right: Republicanism, the Cult of Nature, and the French Revolution*] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), examines how liberal natural right theories, classical republicanism, and the myth of the golden age became fused in eighteenth-century political culture, only to emerge as a violent ideology during the Terror. This book won the [2009 Oscar Kenshur Book Prize]. He recently published a second book entitled [*The Enlightenment: A Geneaology*] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, forthcoming Dec. 2010), which explores how the idea of an Enlightenment emerged in French academic circles around the 1720's. He is currently working on two book projects: first, on the concept of "counter-mythologies" during the Enlightenment and in the aftermath of the French Revolution; and second, on the "myth of the Revolution."  


####Paula Findlen  
Ubaldo Pierotti Professor of Italian History; Co-Director, Center for Medieval and Early Modern Studies; Primary Investigator, Mapping the Republic of Letters  
<span id="findlen"></span>

Paula Findlen teaches history of science before it was "science" (which is, after all, a nineteenth-century word). Her main interests are the scientific revolution, natural history before Darwin, and the history of medicine; her regional emphasis is on Italy in the age of Galileo.  

Professor Findlen received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and taught at the University of California, Davis and Harvard before coming to Stanford. She is the author of Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), which received the 1995 Howard Marraro Prize in Italian History and the 1996 Pfizer Prize for best book in History of Science. Her new book on women in early modern science entitled, The Daughters of Galileo: Knowledge and Desire at the End of the Scientific Revolution, will appear in 1998. Eventually she hopes to finish another project, When Science Became Serious. But she is trying not to be too serious about it...

####Caroline Winterer  
Professor of History, Stanford University  
<span id="winterer"></span>

Caroline Winterer specializes in the intellectual and cultural history of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America. She is the author of two books: *The Mirror Antiquity: American Women and the Classical Tradition, 1750-1900* (2007) and *The Culture of Classicism: Ancient Greece and Rome in American Intellectual Life, 1780-1910* (2002; pb 2004). She has also published articles in the *Journal of American History*, the *American Quarterly*, the *Journal of the Early Republic*, and *Modern Intellectual History*. She is the recipient of fellowships from the National Humanities Center, the Mellon Foundation, the Stanford Humanities Center, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  


####Giovanna Ceserani 
Professor of Classics, Stanford University  
<span id="ceserani"></span>

Giovanna Ceserani works on the classical tradition with an emphasis on the intellectual history of classical scholarship, historiography and archaeology from the eighteenth century onwards. She is interested in the role that Hellenism and Classics played in the shaping of modernity and, in turn, in how the questions we ask of the classical past originate in specific modern cultural, social and political contexts.  

Her book *Italy's Lost Greece: Magna Graecia and the making of modern archaeology* was published by Oxford University Press in 2012.  Her current book project concerns the emergence of modern histories of ancient Greece; she is now also writing on the transformations of antiquarianism in the eighteenth century and on modern travels to ancient lands. Her interest in travel is engaging new digital approaches with a focus on the Grand Tour for the Stanford digital humanities project *Mapping the Republic of Letters*.   


####Marcelo Aranda  
PhD candidate, Department of History, Stanford University
<span id="aranda"></span>
Marcelo Aranda is a doctoral candidate in the Department of History at Stanford University, with a BA in History from UC-Berkeley.  His research explores the intersections between science, politics and religion in the Spanish Empire.  Marcelo has been a research fellow at the John Carter Brown Library and the Huntington Library.  For the 2012-2013 academic year, Marcelo will be a Geballe Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center.  

Aranda’s dissertation addresses the transition in the Spanish world from scientific culture and networks that were predominantly Scholastic, global and centered on Jesuit colleges, to those that were Newtonian, European and centered on scientific academies.  By exploring the diverse uses of scientific instruments in Spain and Mexico, not only as a means to understand nature, but also as social, political and religious tools, he highlights the diversity of scientific practice in both metropole and colony and the changing nature and importance of scientific expertise.  



####Sarah Murray  
Stanford PhD, 2013; Visiting Assistant Professor, Classics, Notre Dame
<span id="murray"></span>
Sarah received her BA in Classical Archaeology from Dartmouth College in 2004.

She has conducted fieldwork in the Southeastern USA, Pompeii, the Nemea Valley, the eastern Corinthia, and East Lokris.  Her dissertation addresses the relationship between imports and ancient trade in Greece during the period from 1300 to 900 B.C.E.  



####Irène Passeron  
Groupe D’Alembert, CNRS, Paris, France
<span id="passeron"></span>
Irène Passeron is a CNRS researcher in the history of mathematics. She coordinates the activities of the Group D'Alembert since 2004.  Ten volumes of both scientific (celestial mechanics, dynamics) and philosophical (Discours préliminaire de l'*Encyclopédie*, *Mélanges*) are in preparation.  For fifteen years, she cares more specifically of D'Alembert correspondence that is published in a critical edition and annotated in 11 volumes.  In connection with the study of the scientific networks of the Enlightenment, she studies many other correspondences.  Irène Passeron and Marie-Laure Massot have been working together since 2005, both in the animation of Group D'Alembert (organization of working sessions, editorial work) and on D'Alembert's correspondence (archival research, work on the database).  


####Marie-Laure Massot
Groupe D’Alembert, CNRS, Paris, France
<span id="massot"></span>
Marie-Laure Massot has been working with the researchers of the Groupe D’Alembert for over eight years since 2004. She contributes as editorial specialist to the long-term project of edition of the complete works of D’Alembert and coordinates conferences in the field of history of science. Her educational background in science and in philosophy, combined to her training as editorial specialist has given her a broad baseline from which to approach history of science and more specifically D’Alembert’s correspondence.  Her contribution in the publication of the *Oeuvres complètes de D'Alembert* may be highlighted by the coming of five volumes of the collection since 2005 (http://dalembert.obspm.fr/). She especially enjoys annotating letters and preparing biographies for D’Alembert’s correspondents.  She is currently Ingénieur d’études CNRS, that is, editorial specialist at the Cirphles Laboratory at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris (http://cirphles.ens.fr/). She joined the *Mapping the Republic of Letters* project during the 2011-2012 academic year at Stanford University and carried out a series of visualizations of D’Alembert’s correspondence, thus initiating the link between the tools developed at Stanford and the D’Alembert project and correspondence database. Beyond the collaboration, it was for her a voyage of discovery into the new challenges and possibilities of Digital Humanities. At the interaction between Humanities, Computer science and Design, this journey triggered a new world of research interests.

####Hannah Marcus  
PhD candidate, Department of History, Stanford University  
2011 Digital Humanities Research Scholar, Mapping the Republic of Letters  

I am a graduate student studying History and the History of Science at Stanford University.  I have been working with the Republic of Letters project in multiple capacities over the past two years.  I have worked on creating datasets that describe Francesco Algarotti’s published, eighteenth-century correspondence and another that captures Benjamin Franklin’s travels.   As a Digital Humanities Research Scholar in the summer of 2011, I worked across all of the Republic of Letters projects with the goal of creating a visualization system that integrated multiple data sets.  Scott Spillman and I presented on this work at a conference at the University of Michigan in April 2012.  In the summer of 2012, I was the Undergraduate Research Lab Manager for the Republic of Letters projects.  In August 2012, I  attended the Early Modern Time + Networks workshop as a Digital Humanities Fellow and worked on the correspondence of Galileo Galilei.   I am very interested in exploring how the digital humanities can complement, clarify, and transform traditional humanistic research.
